A distortion guitar pedal.

This is my first PCB board. I got the inspiration from http://tonepad.com/project.asp?id=49, which is a really good website for guitar pedal DIY lovers.

I used a TL071ACP as the op-amp, which is low-noise and suitable for a wide supply range. These characteristics of the op-amp were really helpful for me as a newcomer to guitar pedal DIY.

The whole process was quite hard for me, since I had to learn a lot of things, like making the schematic, adding the footswitch, and learning Altium Designer, etc. However, the whole process was really fun, and I also learned a lot from this project. I believe I will make more fun and excellent guitar pedals in the future.
